                <h4>Task: Wall Construction</h4>
                <p style="color: #2F5496;text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mitigation Techniques:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Prevent:</strong> Think about eliminating or reducing lifting and carrying risks where
                    possible. Consider:
                <ul>
                    <li>Using mechanical lifting aids like conveyors, hoists, telehandlers, or cranes. Specialist
                        devices and attachments (<a href="https://www.example.com/specialist-devices.pdf">PDF</a>)
                        (e.g., for windows) are also available.</li>
                    <li>Delivering materials directly to their point of use. Plan ahead so you can lift materials into
                        the building and distribute them by pallet truck while plant such as cranes and telehandlers
                        still have access.</li>
                    <li>Making the load smaller or lighter and easier to lift (e.g., using lighter trench blocks with
                        handholds (<a href="https://www.example.com/lighter-trench-blocks.pdf">PDF</a>) instead of heavy
                        ones or alternative lighter materials for kerbs instead of concrete).</li>
                    <li>Different construction methods (e.g., a panel wall system or cluster laying and concrete pour
                        foundations instead of block laying).</li>
                    <li>Using pre-mixed mortar, a batch mix silo, or concrete pumps/trucks instead of mixing on-site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keeping materials dry (<a href="https://www.example.com/keeping-materials-dry.pdf">PDF</a>) to
                        stop them gaining weight or becoming slippery when handled.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Control:</strong> Even if you minimize some of the risks this way, you may still do other
                    work that can involve significant lifting or carrying. Control the risk by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual lifting and carrying aids – many devices are available (<a
                            href="https://www.example.com/manual-lifting-aids.pdf">PDF</a>) including pallet trucks,
                        sack barrows, trolleys, lifting devices, and grips to help better grasp loads. These reduce the
                        risk of injury by applying your body forces more efficiently. Make sure it is correct for the
                        work you are doing. Unsuitable equipment can expose you to unnecessary risks.</li>
                    <li>Layout – allow adequate room for the work. Reduce the need to bend to materials (<a
                            href="https://www.example.com/reducing-need-to-bend.pdf">PDF</a>), twist, stoop, or stretch.
                        Where possible, store heavier loads at waist height. Only store lighter or more
                        easily/infrequently handled items on the floor. Mast climbers (<a
                            href="https://www.example.com/mast-climbers.pdf">PDF</a>) provide an alternative work
                        platform to scaffolding while allowing the platform height to be precisely controlled so workers
                        can lay materials at the most comfortable and productive height.</li>
                    <li>Environment – the ground should be even and firm where possible, particularly when
                        pushing/pulling loads. Use suitable coverings if necessary. Keep the workspace clean and tidy.
                        Ensure sufficient lighting so that workers can clearly see what they are doing. Avoid working in
                        extremes of temperature if possible. Provide the right additional controls or personal
                        protective equipment (PPE) where you cannot change these conditions.</li>
                    <li>Work practices – make sure that the work rate is suitable for the task. Rest and rotate workers
                        if needed.</li>
                    <li>Information – make sure you are aware of the weight of the products you are lifting.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
